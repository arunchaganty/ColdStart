                        input queries with the <slot> field. With three
                        arguments it generates a second round query file based
                        on the first round slot filling output.

# 3 Generating the official scores

The scorer runs over submission in SF format. For participants of KB variant of ColdStart, the KB would need to be transformed to the SF format which would then be used by the scorer. 

In order to generate scores for an SF submission, please skip to Section # 3.2 of this README. For transforming the KB submission to SF format, please move on to the next section.

## 3.1 Transforming a KB submission to SF format

This step is only required for teams participating in the KB variant of Cold Start. For scoring the SF submission as produced by teams participating in the SF variant of Cold Start please skip to Section # 3.2 of this README. 

In order to generate SF output from a KB submission, please follow the steps given below:

1. Validate KB
2. Transform validated KB to SF output format

### 3.1.1 Validate KB

In order to validate a KB named `CSrun`, you may run the following command:

~~~
perl CS-ValidateKB.pl -docs tac_2015_kbp_english_cold_start_evaluation_source_corpus.doclengths.txt -task CSKB -output tac -error_file CSrun.errlog -output_file CSrun.valid CSrun
~~~

This will produce the validated KB in file `CSrun.valid`.

### 3.1.2 Transform validated KB to SF output format

In order to transform the validated KB `CSrun.valid` to SF output, you may run the following command:

~~~
perl CS-ResolveQueries.pl -error_file CSrun.errlog tac_kbp_2015_english_cold_start_slot_filling_evaluation_queries_v2.xml CSrun.valid CSrun.SF
~~~

This will produce the transformed SF output in `CSrun.SF`.

## 3.2 Apply a patch to correct query IDs generated for round # 2 (or hop-1)

If round # 2 (or hop-1) query IDs were generated from the scripts generated from the ColdStartLib.pm that contained a bug in how these query IDs were generated, you would need to apply a patch to the SF submission or SF output transformed from validated KB as produced in Section # 3.1.2 in this README.

This bug was present in all the scripts released to TAC participants at this year submission time.

In order to apply the patch, you may run the following command:

~~~
perl CS-ValidateSF-QueryIDCorrector.pl -docs tac_2015_kbp_english_cold_start_evaluation_source_corpus.doclengths.txt -error_file CSrun.errlog -output_file CSrun.SF.corrected tac_kbp_2015_english_cold_start_slot_filling_evaluation_queries_v2.xml CSrun.SF
~~~

This would created a patched file `CSrun.SF.corrected`.

If you needed to apply the patch, you would need to rename the file `CSrun.SF.corrected` as `CSrun.SF` before moving on to the next section.

### 3.3 Validate SF output

The next step is to validate SF output produced in the previous step. This may be done by runing the following command:

~~~
perl CS-ValidateSF.pl -docs tac_2015_kbp_english_cold_start_evaluation_source_corpus.doclengths.txt -error_file CSrun.errlog -output_file CSrun.valid.ldc.tab.txt tac_kbp_2015_english_cold_start_slot_filling_evaluation_queries_v2.xml CSrun.SF
~~~

This will produce validated SF output in `CSrun.valid.ldc.tab.txt`.

### 3.4 Score SF output 

Finally, the last step is to produce scores for the submission. The micro-average score computes a single P/R/F1 by summing counts across all selected queries. The macro-average score computes P/R/F1 for each query, and finally takes the mean of the query-level F1 scores for queries that have a known answer.  (Note that because the macro-average score ignores queries that have no known answer, a separate metric is needed to evaluate queries with no known answer.)

#### 3.4.1 Producing the CS-SF level scores

Following command may be run to produce the micro average scores at the CS-SF level.

~~~
perl CS-Score.pl -output_file CSrun.score.cssf.txt -queries cssf_queryids.txt -combo MICRO tac_kbp_2015_english_cold_start_slot_filling_evaluation_queries_v2.xml CSrun.valid.ldc.tab.txt pool.assessed.fqec
~~~

Notice that we have used the -queries switch to score selected queries. Also, note that our is assumption is that the assessment are placed in `pool.assessed.fqec`.

The scores will be produced in `CSrun.score.cssf.txt`.

#### 3.4.2 Producing the CS-LDC level scores (COMBO)  (UNTESTED - do not exercise this option)

Following command may be run to produce the micro average scores at the CS-LDC level.

~~~
perl CS-Score.pl -output_file CSrun.score.csldc.combo.txt -queries csldc_queryids.txt -combo UNION -expand CSSF15_ENG tac_kbp_2015_english_cold_start_evaluation_queries_v2.xml CSrun.valid.ldc.tab.txt pool.assessed.fqec
~~~

The scores will be produced in `CSrun.score.csldc.combo.txt`.

# 4 Understanding the output

## 4.1 CS-SF level scores - MICRO AVERAGE

For each query and hop level, the CS-Score.pl scorer outputs the following counts:
    GT	       Total number of ground truth answers (equivalence classes) as found by the assessors,
    Right      Number of correct answers (equivalence classes) found in the submission,
    Wrong      Number of responses in the submission counted as Wrong, 
    Dup	       Number of responses counted as Wrong because they were assessed as Correct but found to be duplicate of another Correct in the same submission, 

For each query and hop level, Precision, Recall and F1 are computed as:
	Precision	= Right / (Right + Wrong)
	Recall		= Right / GT
	F1			= 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall)

Note that scores for round # 2 (or hop-1) are reported at the equivalence class (EC) level and not at the generated query level. For example, the scores given for `CSSF15_ENG_0458206f71:2` are the scores corresponding to the entity found as answer for round # 1 (or hop-0) query `CSSF15_ENG_0458206f71` which was placed by assessors in equivalence class 2. Similarly, the scores given for `CSSF15_ENG_0458206f71:0` are the scores corresponding to all hop-1 answers which correspond to incorrect hop-0 fillers. 

Final scores are micro averages and are computed for both hops separately and combined. 
These final scores are computed as:

	Total_Precision = Total_Right / (Total_Right + Total_Wrong)
	Total_Recall = Total_Right / Total_GT
	Total_F1 = 2 * Total_Precision * Total_Recall / (Total_Precision + Total_Recall)

## 4.2 CS-LDC level MAX scores - MICRO AVERAGE

These scores are computed from the SF level scores as described in Section # 4.1 of this README. In this case, the LDC level scores and counts are the same as the SF level scores and counts corresponding to the entry point for the LDC query that has maximal F1 combined over both hops.

## 4.3 CS-LDC level RANDOM scores - MICRO AVERAGE

These scores are computed from the SF level scores as described in Section # 4.1 of this README. In this case, the LDC level scores and counts are the same as the SF level scores and counts corresponding to the entry point for the LDC query that is specified in the mapping file.
