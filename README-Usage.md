# 3 Overview of various scenarios

Starting in 2017, the ColdStart KB will allow assertions involving events, and sentiments, in addition to the those involving standard slot-filling slots from the previous year. The participants will also be encouraged to specify external links to the nodes.

The ColdStart KB will undergo evaluations at multiple levels: 

(1) Query-based evaluation of the entire KB, and
(2) Evaluation of components extracted from the KB

This README describes steps required to generate the validated files necessary for the evaluations. 

## 3.1 Generating valid input file for query-based evaluation of the entire KB

This section describes how to produce a validated KB in order to support query-based KB evaluation. In order to validate a KB named `CSrun.tac`, you may run the following command:

~~~
perl CS-ValidateKB-MASTER.pl -docs tac_kbp_2017_evaluation_source_corpus_character_counts.tsv -error_file CSrun.errlog -output tac CSrun.tac
~~~

Notice that running this command with `-output tac` makes the validator produce nothing but a validated KB. The output will be written in the file named `CSrun.tac.valid` and will be stored at the location as that of the `CSrun.tac`. The location of the output can be changed by using `-output_dir /path/to/output`.

## 3.2 Generating valid input file for evaluating Slot Filling component

This section describes how to produce a valid input for component-based slot-filling evaluation. In order to produce this file, you may run the following command:

~~~
perl CS-ResolveQueries.pl -error_file CSrun.errlog tac_kbp_2017_cold_start_slot_filling_evaluation_queries.xml CSrun.tac.valid CSrun.SF
~~~

The output will be written in the file named `CSrun.SF`. Also, note that we are using the validated KB `CSrun.tac.valid` as one of the input files instead of the original KB `CSrun.tac`.

Once you have generated the validated KB `CSrun.tac.valid`, you would run the following command in order to generate the validated SF file necessary for component-based slot-filling evaluation:

~~~
perl CS-ValidateSF-MASTER.pl -error_file CSrun.SF.errlog -docs tac_kbp_2017_evaluation_source_corpus_character_counts.tsv -output_file CSrun.valid.ldc.tab.txt tac_kbp_2017_cold_start_slot_filling_evaluation_queries.xml CSrun.SF
~~~

The output of this step `CSrun.valid.ldc.tab.txt` will be used for component-based slot-filling evaluation.

## 3.3 Generating valid input file for evaluating Entity Discovery and Linking component

This section describes how to produce a valid input for component-based entity discovery and linking evaluation. In order to produce this file, you may run the following command:

~~~
perl CS-ValidateKB-MASTER.pl -docs tac_kbp_2017_evaluation_source_corpus_character_counts.tsv -error_file CSrun.errlog -output edl CSrun.tac
~~~

Notice that running this command with `-output edl` makes the validator produce nothing but a valid input for component-based entity discovery and linking evaluation. The output will be written in the file named `CSrun.edl.valid` and will be stored at the location as that of the `CSrun.tac`. The location of the output can be changed by using `-output_dir /path/to/output`.

## 3.4 Generating Valid input file for evaluating Event Arguments component

This section describes how to produce a valid input for component-based event arguments evaluation. In order to produce this file, you may run the following command:

~~~
perl CS-ValidateKB-MASTER.pl -docs tac_kbp_2017_evaluation_source_corpus_character_counts.tsv -error_file CSrun.errlog -output eal CSrun.tac
~~~

Notice that running this command with `-output eag` makes the validator produce nothing but a valid input for component-based event arguments evaluation. The output will be written in the directory named `event_arguments` and will be stored at the location as that of the `CSrun.tac`. The location of the output can be changed by using `-output_dir /path/to/output`.

## 3.5 Generating Valid input file for evaluating Event Nuggets component

This section describes how to produce a valid input for component-based event nuggets evaluation. In order to produce this file, you may run the following command:

~~~
perl CS-ValidateKB-MASTER.pl -docs tac_kbp_2017_evaluation_source_corpus_character_counts.tsv -error_file CSrun.errlog -output nug CSrun.tac
~~~

Notice that running this command with `-output eng` makes the validator produce nothing but a valid input for component-based event nuggets evaluation. The output will be written in the file named `CSrun.eng.valid` and will be stored at the location as that of the `CSrun.tac`. The location of the output can be changed by using `-output_dir /path/to/output`.

## 3.5 Generating Valid input file for evaluating BeST component

This section describes how to produce a valid input for component-based BeSt evaluation. In order to produce this file, you may run the following command:

~~~
perl CS-ValidateKB-MASTER.pl -docs tac_kbp_2017_evaluation_source_corpus_character_counts.tsv -error_file CSrun.errlog -output sen CSrun.tac
~~~

Notice that running this command with `-output sen` makes the validator produce nothing but a valid input for component-based BeSt evaluation. The output will be written in the directory named `sentiments` and will be stored at the location as that of the `CSrun.tac`. The location of the output can be changed by using `-output_dir /path/to/output`.

## 3.6 Generating Valid input file for evaluating multiple components at the same time

The value of the `-output` switch does not need to be a singular value, rather it can be a list of values separated by a colon (:). Therefore, given `CSrun.tac`, if you need to generate input files for any of the components, you would need to use the corresponding value as an element in the list for the value of `-output`. For example, given `CSrun.tac`, if you want to produce the input files for all of the above evaluations except that of slot-filling you would run the following command:

~~~
perl CS-ValidateKB-MASTER.pl -docs tac_kbp_2017_evaluation_source_corpus_character_counts.tsv -error_file CSrun.errlog -output tac:edl:sen:eal:nug CSrun.tac
~~~
